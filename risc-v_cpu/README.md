# Introduction

In this lab, you will enhance your existing 3-stage RISC-V processor with
branching and jump instructions. These will require some changes to parts of
your pipeline, but will greatly improve the range of programs your CPU will be
able to accept.

# Proposed Approach

This lab builds on the work you have done in the previous lab, and will require
you to extend several parts in order to support branch and jump type
instructions. This section will outline several major modifications you will
want to explore in completing this lab.

You will want to **extend your instruction decoder module** (or whatever other
system you were using for decoding instructions) to support the two new
instruction formats (B-type and J-type). For both types these should result in
one or more sign-extended immediate values being produced (for the jump target
offset).

You will also want to **extend your control unit** to support the new
instructions.  This will probably require you to add new cases to deal with
B-type and J-type instructions. You will also want to add an extra I-type case
to deal with the `jalr` instruction.

Your **fetching logic will need to change** as well, in order to support jumps
and branches. We recommend the modifications suggested in the lecture 4 slides,
which will change `PC_FETCH` from incrementing each cycle, to a more complex
design.

You will need to handle the following cases in your updated fetch logic:

 - `PC_FETCH + 1` :: Normal next instruction.
 - `branch_addr_EX` :: Address to jump to if the branch is taken.
    (An offset from the current PC value.)
 - `jal_addr_EX` :: Jump target of a `jal` instruction.
    (An offset from the current PC value.)
 - `jalr_addr_EX` :: Jump to address specified in the `jalr` instruction.
    (`rs1` + offset)

We also recommend creating a `stall_FETCH` and `stall_EX` set of control
signals (likely tied to the control unit) as a way of propagating stalls across
your pipeline. You can use the stall signals to short out the regfile write-
enable signal to ensure the instruction already executing is a no-op.

We recommend making these modifications incrementally -- just one group of
instructions at a time. This can make it easier to spot errors in your
implementation, since you will be testing the updated fetching and branch
control logic as you go. A good place to start would be the unconditional
jump instruction `jal`.

Note that to support using the HEX displays, you should re-use your
`hexdecoder` module from the previous lab.

# Design Requirements

* (i) Your CPU must implement a three-stage pipeline
  * At a given clock cycle, your CPU should be fetching one instruction,
    stalling or executing another, and possibly (if not stalled) writing the
    result of a third instruction to the register file.
* (ii) Your CPU must implement all of the R-Type instructions listed in the
  previous lab.

* (iii) Your CPU must implement all of the I-Type instructions listed in in the
  previous lab, plus `jal` as noted in *Appendix A*

* (iv) Your CPU must implement all of the U-Type instructions listed in the
  previous lab.

* (v) Your CPU must implement all of the J-Type instructions listed in
  *Appendix A*.

* (vi) Your CPU must implement all of the B-Type instructions listed in
  *Appendix *.

* (vii) You must write a complete suite of test cases that validate your CPU
  works
  * To check if your test suite works, try choosing an instruction at random,
  and modify your control unit to produce incorrect values for that
  instruction, then run your test suite. Did your test suite throw an error? If
  not, it is incomplete. You should complete this process at least a couple of
  times for different instructions.
* (viii) The instruction `csrrw x0 io2 rs1` should cause the value of register
  `rs1` to be displayed on the hex displays.
* (ix) The instruction `csrrw rd io0 x0` should modify the value of register
  `rd` to be set to the current switch value.
* (x) You must write a RISC-V assembler program, which you should save
  as `sqrt.asm`. This program should read a value from the switches (`io0`),
  and should the display the square root of that value as a decimal number on
  the HEX displays in (8,5) base 10 fixed point.
	* For example, to display 3.75, your program would show `00375000` on
	  the hex displays.
	* Another example: an input of `17` (`18'b10001`) on the switches
	  should cause a value of approximately `00412311` to be displayed on
	  the hex displays.
	* Your program should produce the correct result within a tolerance
	  of $\frac{1}{100000}$.
	* **Tip**: you are encouraged to combine the square root code you wrote
	  in lab 1 with your bin2dec code from lab 3.

The behavior of your CPU will be considered correct for a given instruction if
any of the following conditions are met, with the exception of the CSRRW
instruction which must work as described in *Apendix D*:

* Your CPU runs the instruction as described in *Appendix D* of this lab sheet.
* Your CPU runs the instruction identically to RARs.
* Your CPU runs the instruction identically to the linked RISC-V RV32I
  specification.

If the above three conditions are in conflict, prefer the lab sheet, but we
will accept any. If you know there is a conflict, this is probably an error on
our part, and you should let us know.

# Rubric

* (A) 30 points -- demonstration of sqrt program operating successfully.

* (B) 20 points -- sqrt program deployed onto the DE2-115 board.

* (C) 30 points -- demonstration of your testing suite.

* (D) 20 points -- explanation of your testing methodology to the TA.

**Maximum score**: 100 points.

All grades will be assigned by demoing your code to the TAs. You may demo in
any lab session, during office hours, or by appointment. Late penalty will be
calculated from the time you turn your code in via Moodle, so it's OK if you
don't get to demo before the lab is due.

When you demo your code to the TA, please be prepared to:

* Show your sqrt program running on the DE2-115 board.
* Show your testbench(es), test vectors, test programs, and any other scripts
  or materials you use to test your design.
* Briefly explain your testing strategy, and justify why you believe it is a
  complete and adequate evaluation of your design's functionality. Be prepared
  to answer questions.

**Optional**: for rubric category (D), if you feel uncomfortable explaining
and justifying your test suite in an oral, in-person setting, you may choose
to instead write a textual report, not to exceed 3 pages, to be submitted as
a PDF via email to the TAs. You will still need to demonstrate the test suite
and bin2dec running however.

Maximum score: 100 points.

Note that the following may cause you to lose points:

* Academic honesty violation, such as turning in another student's code.
* Code which does not compile.
  difficult to grade your project.

## What to Turn In

When you are satisfied that your design works correctly, generate your
submission file with `make pack`. Your submission file must be named
`CSCE611_<Semester>_jb_<Your USC Username>.7z`. Your "USC username" is
whatever you log into your university computer accounts with. For example,
a student with the email address `jsmith@email.sc.edu` might turn in a file
named `CSCE611_Fall2021_jb_jsmith.7z`. Please use the provided Make target,
**do not pack your submission manually**.


# Appendix A - RV32I I/J/B Instruction Reference

Note: In some cases, instructions are grouped with types other than their
actual encoding for logical clarity. Such cases are specifically noted.

Note: All immediate values should be sign-extended. The sign bit of all
immediate values is in the most-significant bit (bit 31) of the instruction.
